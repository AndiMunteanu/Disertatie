\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I acknowledge the support and supervision of Professor Liviu Ciortuz. I am indebted for the patience and knowledge shared with me over the past few years. During my MSc, I was also fortunate to collaborate closely with the Core Bioinformatics group at the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and get acquainted with cutting-edge problems in bioinformatics. 

This thesis is based on the ClustAssess manuscript \cite{clustassess} to which I contributed as co-author. All the figures used in the last three chapters are also presented in the paper. The writing of the article and the development of the \verb|ClustAssess| package was done under the supervision and mentorship of professor Irina Mohorianu and Arash Shahsavari (Core Bioinformatics Group, Cambridge Stem Cell institute), as part of my internship at the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute during the summer of 2021. The experiments and benchmarks were performed on the CSCI computing infrastructure. The ClustAssess code is publicly available on the Core Bioinformatics GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/Core-Bioinformatics/ClustAssess} and can be used for academic purposes under the MIT license.
