This thesis is based on the ClustAssess paper \cite{clustassess} where I contributed as co-author. All the figures used in the last three chapters are also used in the paper. The writing of the article and the development of the \verb|ClustAssess| package was done under the supervision and mentorship of professor Irina Mohorianu and Arash Shahsavari from the Core Bioinformatics Group of the Cambridge Stem Cell institute. The experiments and benchmark were also performed on a server belonging to the Core Bioinformatics group. The code of the package is made publicly available at the GitHub repository \url{https://github.com/Core-Bioinformatics/ClustAssess} and can be used under the MIT license.
