This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

Here we investigate the transcriptional dynamics of mouse organogenesis at single-cell resolution. Using single-cell combinatorial indexing, we profiled the transcriptomes of around 2 million cells derived from 61 embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation, in a single experiment. The resulting `mouse organogenesis cell atlas' (MOCA) provides a global view of developmental processes during this critical window. We~use Monocle 3 to identify hundreds of cell types and 56 trajectories, many of which are detected only because of the depth of cellular coverage, and collectively define thousands of corresponding marker genes. We explore the dynamics of gene expression within cell types and trajectories over time, including focused analyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle.},

Moreover, we demonstrate how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Graph clustering, also known as network community detection, is often performed by optimizing such a function. Two axioms tailored for graph clustering quality functions are introduced, and the four axioms introduced in previous work on distance based clustering are reformulated and generalized for the graph setting. We show that modularity, a standard quality function for graph clustering, does not satisfy all of these six properties. This motivates the derivation of a new family of quality functions, adaptive scale modularity, which does satisfy the proposed axioms. Adaptive scale modularity has two parameters, which give greater flexibility in the kinds of clusterings that can be found. Standard graph clustering quality functions, such as normalized cut and unnormalized cut, are obtained as special cases of adaptive scale modularity. In general, the results of our investigation indicate that the considered axiomatic framework covers existing `good' quality functions for graph clustering, and can be used to derive an interesting new family of quality functions.}

  abstract = {Modularity is a widely used quality measure for graph clusterings. Its exact maximization is NP-hard and prohibitively expensive for large graphs. Popular heuristics first perform a coarsening phase, where local search starting from singleton clusters is used to compute a preliminary clustering, and then optionally a refinement phase, where this clustering is improved by moving vertices between clusters. As a generalization, multilevel heuristics coarsen in several stages, and refine by moving entire clusters from each of these stages, not only individual vertices. This article organizes existing and new single-level and multilevel heuristics into a coherent design space, and compares them experimentally with respect to their effectiveness (achieved modularity) and runtime. For coarsening by iterated cluster joining, it turns out that the most widely used criterion for joining clusters (modularity increase) is outperformed by other simple criteria, that a recent multistep algorithm [Schuetz and Caflisch 2008] is no improvement over simple single-step coarsening for these criteria, and that the recent multilevel coarsening by iterated vertex moving [Blondel et al. 2008] is somewhat faster but slightly less effective (with refinement). The new multilevel refinement is significantly more effective than the conventional single-level refinement or no refinement, in reasonable runtime. A comparison with published benchmark results and algorithm implementations shows that multilevel local search heuristics, despite their relative simplicity, are competitive with the best algorithms in the literature.},

It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.}

The tools provide fine-grained information enabling (a) the detection of optimal number of clusters, (b) identification of regions of similarity (and divergence) across methods, (c) a data driven assessment of optimal parameter ranges. The aim is to assist practitioners in evaluating the robustness of cell-identity inference based on the partitioning, and provide information for choosing robust clustering methods and parameters.We illustrate its use on three case studies: a single-cell dataset of in-vivo hematopoietic stem and progenitors (10x Genomics scRNA-seq), in-vitro endoderm differentiation (SMART-seq), and multimodal in-vivo peripheral blood (10x RNA+ATAC). The additional checks offer novel viewpoints on clustering stability, and provide a framework for consistent decision-making on preprocessing, method choice, and parameters for clustering.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Biological functions emerge from complex and dynamic networks of protein–protein interactions. Because these protein–protein interaction networks, or interactomes, represent pairwise connections within a hierarchically organized system, it is often useful to identify higher-order associations embedded within them, such as multimember protein complexes. Graph-based clustering techniques are widely used to accomplish this goal, and dozens of field-specific and general clustering algorithms exist. However, interactomes can be prone to errors, especially when inferred from high-throughput biochemical assays. Therefore, robustness to network-level noise is an important criterion. Here, we tested the robustness of a range of graph-based clustering algorithms in the presence of noise, including algorithms common across domains and those specific to protein networks. Strikingly, we found that all of the clustering algorithms tested here markedly amplified network-level noise. Randomly rewiring only 1% of network edges yielded more than a 50% change in clustering results. Moreover, we found the impact of network noise on individual clusters was not uniform: some clusters were consistently robust to injected noise, whereas others were not. Therefore we developed the clust.perturb R package and Shiny web application to measure the reproducibility of clusters by randomly perturbing the network. We show that clust.perturb results are predictive of real-world cluster stability: poorly reproducible clusters as identified by clust.perturb are significantly less likely to be reclustered across experiments. We conclude that graph-based clustering amplifies noise in protein interaction networks, but quantifying the robustness of a cluster to network noise can separate stable protein complexes from spurious associations.}

While modularity remains one of the more popular methods of community detection, the so-called resolution limit remains a significant drawback. To overcome this issue, it was recently suggested that instead of comparing the network to a random null model, as is done in modularity, it should be compared to a constant factor. However, it is unclear what is meant exactly by ``resolution-limit-free,'' that is, not suffering from the resolution limit. Furthermore, the question remains what other methods could be classified as resolution-limit-free. In this paper we suggest a rigorous definition and derive some basic properties of resolution-limit-free methods. More importantly, we are able to prove exactly which class of community detection methods are resolution-limit-free. Furthermore, we analyze which methods are not resolution-limit-free, suggesting there is only a limited scope for resolution-limit-free community detection methods. Finally, we provide such a natural formulation, and show it performs superbly.}

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity optimization, among which the popular ``Louvain algorithm''. The computational efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and medium-sized networks.

An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that belong to the same cell types based on gene expression patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes).Results: In this article, we describe a novel algorithm named shared nearest neighbor (SNN)-Cliq that clusters single-cell transcriptomes. SNN-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling high-dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real experimental datasets, SNN-Cliq outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested. More importantly, the clustering results of SNN-Cliq reflect the cell types or origins with high accuracy.Availability and implementation: The algorithm is implemented in MATLAB and Python.
